## üîß **NETLIFY BUILD ISSUE - COMPLETELY RESOLVED**

### ‚ö° **The Fix That Worked:**

**Problem**: `sh: 1: vite: not found` during build  
**Solution**: Enhanced build script with explicit dependency management

**Successful Configuration:**
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "chmod +x netlify-build.sh && ./netlify-build.sh"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  CI = "true"
```

**Key Success Factors:**
1. ‚úÖ Custom build script (`netlify-build.sh`) with dependency verification
2. ‚úÖ Moved `vite` to production dependencies in `package.json`
3. ‚úÖ Added TypeScript compilation step before Vite build
4. ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and logging
5. ‚úÖ Fallback configurations prepared for reliability
