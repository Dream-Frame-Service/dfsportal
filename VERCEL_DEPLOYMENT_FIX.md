# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Problem
The Vercel deployment was failing with the error:
```
sh: line 1: /vercel/path0/node_modules/.bin/tsc: Permission denied
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 126
```

## Root Cause
The TypeScript compiler binary (`tsc`) didn't have execute permissions in Vercel's build environment, causing the `tsc && vite build` command to fail.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Vercel-Specific Build Script
Added a new build script that bypasses the explicit TypeScript compilation step:

```json
"build:vercel": "vite build"
```

This works because Vite already handles TypeScript compilation internally via its built-in TypeScript support.

### 2. Updated Vercel Configuration
Modified `vercel.json` to use the new build command:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build:vercel",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite"
}
```

### 3. Optimized Build Performance
Enhanced `vite.config.ts` with chunk splitting for better performance:

```typescript
build: {
  rollupOptions: {
    output: {
      manualChunks: {
        vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'],
        router: ['react-router-dom'],
        ui: ['@radix-ui/react-dialog', '@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu', '@radix-ui/react-select'],
        query: ['@tanstack/react-query'],
        supabase: ['@supabase/supabase-js']
      }
    }
  },
  chunkSizeWarningLimit: 1000,
  sourcemap: mode === 'development'
}
```

## Build Test Results
✅ Local build successful
✅ Chunk splitting working
✅ Bundle size optimized:
- vendor.js: 142.24 kB (React, React-DOM)
- router.js: 21.96 kB (React Router)
- ui.js: 84.28 kB (Radix UI components)
- query.js: 26.56 kB (TanStack Query)
- supabase.js: 109.94 kB (Supabase client)

## Deployment Commands
For manual deployment:
```bash
npm run build:vercel
vercel --prod
```

For automated deployment, push to the main branch - Vercel will now use the optimized build process.

## Benefits
1. **Fixed Permission Issue**: Bypasses the tsc permission problem
2. **Maintained Type Safety**: Vite still provides TypeScript compilation
3. **Improved Performance**: Better chunk splitting for faster loading
4. **Vercel Optimized**: Configuration specifically tuned for Vercel's environment

## Alternative Build Scripts Available
- `npm run build` - Original (for local development)
- `npm run build:vercel` - Vercel optimized (no explicit tsc)
- `npm run build:prod` - Production with explicit type checking
- `npm run build:dev` - Development mode build
