# ðŸ”§ Netlify Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: "vite: command not found"

### Problem Description
The Netlify build process is failing with the error `sh: 1: vite: not found` even though `vite` is listed in the dependencies.

### Applied Fixes

#### 1. âœ… Moved Vite to Dependencies
- **Change**: Moved `vite` and `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`
- **Reason**: Netlify production builds might not install devDependencies
- **Status**: âœ… Completed

#### 2. âœ… Updated Build Scripts  
- **Change**: Added TypeScript compilation (`tsc`) before Vite build in package.json
- **Reason**: Ensures all TypeScript files are compiled before bundling
- **Status**: âœ… Completed

#### 3. âœ… Enhanced Netlify Configuration
- **Change**: Updated `netlify.toml` with better environment variables and build command
- **Reason**: More reliable build process with explicit dependency installation
- **Status**: âœ… Completed

#### 4. âœ… Created Custom Build Script
- **File**: `netlify-build.sh`
- **Features**:
  - Explicit dependency installation verification
  - Vite availability checking
  - Detailed logging for debugging
  - Error handling and exit codes
- **Status**: âœ… Completed

### Current Build Configuration

**netlify.toml:**
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "chmod +x netlify-build.sh && ./netlify-build.sh"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  NPM_FLAGS = ""
  CI = "true"
  NETLIFY_USE_YARN = "false"
```

**package.json build script:**
```json
"build": "tsc && vite build"
```

### Alternative Solutions (If Current Fix Fails)

#### Option 1: Direct NPX Usage
Update netlify.toml:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm ci && npx vite build"
```

#### Option 2: Simplified Build
Update netlify.toml:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm install && npm run build"
```

#### Option 3: Force Vite Installation
Update netlify.toml:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm install && npm install vite && npm run build"
```

### Manual Deployment Steps (Backup Plan)

If automated deployment continues to fail:

1. **Local Build:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Manual Netlify Deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```

### Monitoring Next Deployment

After the current push:
1. âœ… Check Netlify build logs at: https://app.netlify.com/sites/dfsmanagerportal/deploys
2. âœ… Verify the new build script executes correctly
3. âœ… Monitor for any remaining dependency issues
4. âœ… Test the deployed application functionality

### Success Indicators

The deployment will be successful when:
- âœ… Netlify build completes without errors
- âœ… `dist` folder is generated correctly
- âœ… Application loads at https://dfsmanagerportal.netlify.app
- âœ… All main features work (routing, database connection, UI components)

### Rollback Plan

If the deployment still fails:
1. Use the fallback configuration in `netlify-fallback.toml`
2. Switch to Vercel deployment (already working): https://dfsportal-2aw828g2c-mobins-projects-e019e916.vercel.app
3. Use GitHub Pages deployment via Actions
