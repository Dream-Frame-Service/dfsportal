## 🔧 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

The **Vercel deployment** appears to be showing 404 errors because it may not have the latest optimized build. The local version works perfectly.

---

## 🎯 **FINAL STEPS TO COMPLETE**

### **Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)**
If you have access to the Vercel dashboard:

1. **Trigger Manual Deploy**: Go to Vercel dashboard → Project → Deploy latest commit
2. **Or Push Changes**: Any Git push will trigger automatic deployment
3. **Verify Build**: Ensure it uses `npm run build:vercel` command

### **Option 2: Manual Deployment**
If using Vercel CLI:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if needed)
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy from project root
cd /workspaces/dfsportal
./deploy-to-vercel.sh
```

### **Option 3: Alternative Deployment**
If Vercel continues having issues, consider deploying to:
- **Netlify** (already configured with `_redirects` file)
- **Cloudflare Pages**
- **Firebase Hosting**
